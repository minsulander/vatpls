## VatPLS

VatPLS is a webapp for keeping track of controller/position staffing, mainly during "live" events, inspired by PLS (PositionsLedningsSystem) used by LFV in Sweden.

### Contributing

Contributions of any kind are most welcome.

- Please file bug reports and/or feature requests as [issues](https://github.com/minsulander/vatpls/issues).
- Pull requests are welcome.

### For developers

It's a fairly straight-forward [Vue3](https://vuejs.org) + [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com) + [Vue-draggable-plus](https://github.com/Alfred-Skyblue/vue-draggable-plus) project.

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

The API needs to be run separately with 

```sh
node server.js
```
