The VATPLS api runs on a **postgres** database and uses **pgadmin** to make server administration more easy. These services are run in a container and therefore requires:

- Docker compose.

Launching the database:

1. navigate to /API folder and copy following to a .env file:

```
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_DB=vatpls
PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=vatpls@vatpls.se
PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=vatpls01
PGUSER=postgres
PGPASSWORD=password
PGDATABASE=vatpls
```

(You can change any of these values)

2. run `docker compose up`, this will download the database, initialize it and also launch it.

3. When the initilzation is done, goto: "localhost:15433". This will open the pgadmin panel, if you have entered the same values as above the login is: "vatpls@vatpls.se" and "vatpls01" for the email and password respectivly.

4. To connect the admin panel to postgres database click on "Add New Server" and fill in a name. In the connection tab:
    - host name/address = `docker inspect postgres_container | grep "IPAddress"`. Run the command in terminal and it returns an ip.
    - username = postgres (or as you filled in .env POSTGRES_USER)
    - password = password (or as you filled in .env POSTGRES_PASSWORD)

Database should now be running locally.
