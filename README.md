## VatPLS

VatPLS is a webapp for keeping track of controller/position staffing during "live" events, inspired by the PLS system used by LFV in Sweden.

### For developers

It's a fairly straight-forward [Vue3](https://vuejs.org) + [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com) project.

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

The API needs to be run separately with 

```sh
node server.js
```
